# Generative AI

## 🧠 What is Generative AI?

Generative AI (GenAI) is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content such as text, images, audio, video, code, and more. It uses machine learning models—especially deep learning and large language models (LLMs)—to learn patterns from existing data and generate new, similar data.

## 🎯 Key Objectives of Generative AI

- **Content Generation**: Generate realistic and creative content like articles, images, music, or even conversations.
- **Task Automation**: Automate repetitive creative tasks (e.g., writing emails, designing UI).
- **Personalization**: Tailor experiences (e.g., chatbots, recommendations) to individual users.
- **Augmented Creativity**: Assist humans in art, writing, code, and research.

## 🧬 How Does Generative AI Work?

Generative AI is typically built on:

### 1. **Neural Networks**
   - Specially **transformer architectures** like GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer), BERT, T5, etc.

### 2. **Training Process**
   - **Pre-training**: Model is trained on large-scale datasets.
   - **Fine-tuning**: Adjusted for specific tasks using task-related data.

### 3. **Types of Models**
   - **Text**: GPT, ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini
   - **Image**: DALL·E, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion
   - **Audio**: Jukebox, Whisper
   - **Video**: Sora (by OpenAI)
